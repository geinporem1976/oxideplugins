AntiOfflineRaid is a structure-related plugin that reduces the amount of damage to player structures by a percentage. The percentage decreases as time passes.


There is a cooldown of 10 minutes before damage reductions will apply.  Meaning players may not necessarily prevent a raid by going offline.


Going afk for more than 5 minutes is the same as going offline.


AntiOfflineRaid determines who owns a structure based on who built it.


There is NO REFUND for wasted explosives.


AOR will not know how long a player has been offline unless they go offline while this plugin is running.  There is no method to determine how long a player was offline before this plugin is installed, AOR will not protect bases for players that are offline since before this plugin is installed.


When unloading or updating AOR, it is recommended to save the server with server.save.

The above configuration is intended to work as follows.


* First 10 minutes offline - 100% damage
* Between 10 and 60 minutes offline - 0% damage
* Between 1 and 3 hours offline - 20% damage
* Between 3 and 6 hours offline - 35% damage
* Between 6 and 12 hours offline - 50% damage
* Between 12 and 48 hours offline - 80% damage
* After 48 hours offline - 100% damage

Cleaning House Option

With damageScale, this plugin may also potentially increase the damage beyond 100% after a certain amount of offline time, therein making it less expensive to raid.  For example, after 168 hours (1 week), raiders could do twice the damage to the structure.


This may be useful on pvp servers without decay to help clear out old bases.
